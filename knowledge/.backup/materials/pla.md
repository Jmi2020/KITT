## Overview

Polylactic Acid (PLA) is a biodegradable, bio-based thermoplastic derived mainly from fermented plant starch such as corn, sugarcane, or tapioca. It is the most popular filament for fused filament fabrication (FFF) 3D printing due to its ease of use, low warping, and good surface quality. PLA is widely used for prototypes, educational models, and consumer products that do not require high thermal or mechanical stress resistance.

## Properties

- **Strength:** PLA exhibits good tensile strength, typically around 45-50 MPa, with a tensile modulus near 2300-3100 MPa, making it quite rigid[1][4].
- **Flexibility:** PLA is relatively brittle with low elongation at break (~5%), meaning it is not very flexible and can fracture under bending stress[1][4].
- **Heat resistance:** PLA has a heat deflection temperature (HDT) around 50-60°C and a glass transition temperature near 60°C, which limits its use in high-temperature environments[1][4][9].
- **UV resistance:** PLA has moderate UV resistance, which helps maintain color and integrity under some exposure to sunlight[3].
- **Water resistance:** PLA is only moderately water-resistant; it can absorb small amounts of water (~0.3% in 24h) but is prone to hydrolytic degradation over time[1][3].

## Applications

PLA is commonly used for:
- Concept models and prototypes due to its ease of printing and good detail[3][6].
- Educational purposes and office use, favored for being odorless and non-toxic[3].
- Cosmetic parts and scale models where mechanical properties are less demanding[6].
- Biodegradable and sustainable product experiments.

## Print Settings

- **Print temperature:** 180-220°C, with a commonly recommended range of 190-210°C for general use[1][3][5].
- **Bed temperature:** Typically 40-60°C to improve adhesion and reduce warping, but some prints can succeed with an unheated bed[1][3].
- **Print speed:** 40-60 mm/s is standard; speeds up to 100 mm/s are achievable depending on the printer and filament[5].
- **Cooling:** Active cooling (e.g., fan) should be enabled to improve surface finish and detail.

## Tips

- Store PLA filament in airtight containers with desiccants to prevent moisture absorption that can degrade print quality[3].
- Use a heated bed or adhesion aids like glue stick or blue tape to prevent warping.
- Printing in a well-ventilated area is recommended despite low odor emission[3].
- Optimize layer orientation and height for improved mechanical strength and fatigue resistance, as these parameters significantly affect final part performance[2].
- Avoid exposing printed parts to high temps (>50°C) or prolonged moisture to maintain structural integrity.

## Environmental Impact

PLA rates highly on sustainability due to being derived from renewable plant sources and biodegradability under industrial composting conditions. It produces fewer emissions during printing compared to petroleum-based plastics like ABS. However, PLA parts are not generally biodegradable in typical home environments and require proper composting facilities for degradation. Overall, PLA is considered an eco-friendlier 3D printing material, scoring around 8/10 on sustainability[3][6].
