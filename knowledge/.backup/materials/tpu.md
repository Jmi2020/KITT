# TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane)

## Overview
TPU is a flexible, rubber-like filament ideal for parts requiring elasticity and durability. Excellent abrasion resistance and chemical resistance.

## Properties
- **Strength**: Moderate (26-52 MPa depending on hardness)
- **Flexibility**: Highly flexible (Shore hardness 85A-95A typical)
- **Heat resistance**: Moderate (softens at 60-70°C)
- **UV resistance**: Good
- **Water resistance**: Excellent

## Applications
- Phone cases and protective gear
- Seals and gaskets
- Vibration dampers
- Wearable accessories
- Tires and wheels

## Print Settings
- **Nozzle temperature**: 220-235°C
- **Bed temperature**: 50-60°C
- **Print speed**: 15-25 mm/s (SLOW)
- **Cooling**: Minimal (20-30% fan)
- **Retraction**: 2-3mm at 20-25mm/s (or disable if possible)

## Tips
- **Print SLOW** - speed is critical for quality
- Use direct drive extruder (Bowden very challenging)
- Disable or minimize retraction
- Increase flow rate slightly (105-110%)
- Clean nozzle frequently (material can ooze)
- Use 100% infill for maximum flexibility

## Environmental Impact
Petroleum-based, not biodegradable. Very durable, extending product life. Some TPU grades are recyclable.
