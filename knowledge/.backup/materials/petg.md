## Overview  
PETG (Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol) is a popular 3D printing filament known for combining the strength and chemical resistance of PET with enhanced durability and flexibility due to glycol modification. It is widely favored for its ease of printing and suitability for both functional and aesthetic prints.

## Properties  
- **Strength:** PETG exhibits good tensile strength, typically around 50 MPa, making it stronger than PLA and suitable for mechanical parts[1][2].  
- **Flexibility:** More flexible than PLA due to glycol content, PETG offers toughness and impact resistance with elongation at break of about 15%, enabling it to handle mechanical stresses well[1][3].  
- **Heat Resistance:** PETG has a heat deflection temperature up to ~70°C and glass transition around 80-85°C, which allows moderate thermal stability suitable for many applications[1][6].  
- **UV Resistance:** PETG is UV stable and resists degradation from sunlight, making it appropriate for outdoor use[3].  
- **Water Resistance:** It is waterproof and chemically resistant, tolerating contact with water, oils, alcohols, and weak acids without degrading[1][3].

## Applications  
Common uses include functional prototypes, mechanical parts, toys, outdoor equipment such as flower pots, food containers, and other items requiring durability, chemical resistance, and some flexibility[1][3].

## Print Settings  
- **Nozzle Temperature:** 220–250°C, typically 230–240°C recommended for best results[1][2][5][6].  
- **Bed Temperature:** 70–85°C to ensure good adhesion and warping minimization[2][5][6].  
- **Print Speed:** 30–60 mm/s is advised; slower speeds improve quality and layer bonding[2][4][5].  
- **Cooling:** Moderate to low cooling fan use, depending on the print, to improve layer adhesion and reduce warping[6].  
- **Drying:** PETG is hygroscopic; drying filament at 60–65°C for 4–6 hours before printing enhances print quality[1][3][5].

## Tips  
- Use a heated bed to prevent warping and improve first-layer adhesion.  
- Print slower for the first layer for better bed adhesion.  
- Minimize cooling fan speed to improve layer bonding.  
- Store PETG in sealed bags with desiccants to prevent moisture absorption.  
- Post-process sanding with heat treatment can restore surface gloss[3].  
- Avoid printing directly on glass without adhesion aids as PETG can stick excessively[4].

## Environmental Impact  
PETG is recyclable and based on PET plastic, a widely recycled polymer. Its production and disposal impact are moderate, with a sustainability score of about 6/10 considering recyclability but also energy consumption for printing and hygroscopic nature affecting filament shelf life. PETG is generally considered more sustainable than ABS but less than PLA, as it is not biodegradable[1][3][4].
