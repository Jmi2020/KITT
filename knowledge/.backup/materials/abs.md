**Overview**

ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) is a common thermoplastic polymer widely used in FDM 3D printing due to its good mechanical properties and heat resistance. It typically requires higher printing temperatures than PLA and benefits strongly from a heated and enclosed print environment to reduce warping and layer adhesion issues.

**Properties**

- **Density:** Approximately 1.04 g/cm³, which is typical for ABS plastics.
- **Key Characteristics:** High impact resistance, decent toughness, moderate flexibility, good thermal resistance compared to PLA. ABS is known for being durable and slightly flexible with good mechanical strength and heat resistance.
- **Common Applications:** Functional prototypes, automotive parts, consumer products, enclosures, and mechanical components demanding durability and moderate heat resistance.

**Print Settings**

| Parameter           | Typical Range            | Notes                                                 |
|---------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Nozzle Temperature  | 220°C – 270°C            | Most commonly 230-250°C; exact depends on filament brand and printer. Higher temps (up to 270°C) may improve flow but risk thermal decomposition. Lower temps may improve overhang surfaces but reduce layer bonding. |
| Bed Temperature      | 90°C – 110°C             | 110°C widely recommended to reduce warping. Heated bed essential. |
| Enclosure Temperature| 40°C – 65°C (ambient)    | Enclosure strongly recommended to keep ambient warm, preventing cracking/warping. |
| Cooling Fan          | Off or very low (~15%)   | Minimal cooling improves layer adhesion; higher fan speeds can cause layer splitting. |

**Cost and Suppliers**

- **Cost per kg:** ABS filament typically ranges around $20 to $40 USD per kg, depending on brand, quality, and additives.
- **Common Suppliers:** 
  - eSUN (noted for standard and modified ABS filaments)
  - Zortrax
  - LulzBot (offers ABS filament and related products)
  - Generic suppliers via platforms like Amazon, MatterHackers, and local distributors.

**Tips and Best Practices**

- *Bed adhesion:* Use ABS juice (ABS dissolved in acetone) or hairspray on the bed to enhance first-layer adhesion.
- *Enclosure:* Printing ABS in an enclosure or box helps maintain steady ambient temperatures and avoids warping/cracking caused by uneven cooling.
- *Temperature tuning:* Start around 240-250°C for the nozzle and 110°C for the bed, then adjust by small increments depending on print quality, layer bonding, and stringing.
- *Avoid fan cooling or keep it minimal* to enhance inter-layer bonding and reduce warping.
- *Bed leveling* must be precise for good adhesion.
- *Trial and error* is common due to filament and printer variability.

Sources collectively emphasize printing ABS at nozzle temperatures of about 220-270°C (commonly centered around 230-250°C) and bed temperatures of about 110°C, with an enclosure to maintain ambient warmth for best results[1][2][3][4][5][6][7]. Density is around 1.04 g/cm³, and costs range roughly $20-$40/kg from established suppliers like eSUN, Zortrax, and LulzBot.
