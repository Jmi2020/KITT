# ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene)

## Overview
ABS is a petroleum-based engineering plastic known for strength, heat resistance, and post-processing capabilities. Requires enclosed printer due to warping.

## Properties
- **Strength**: High (40-50 MPa), excellent toughness
- **Flexibility**: Moderate impact resistance
- **Heat resistance**: High (softens at 105°C)
- **UV resistance**: Poor (yellows over time)
- **Water resistance**: Excellent

## Applications
- Functional parts requiring heat resistance
- Automotive components
- Electronic enclosures
- Post-processed parts (acetone smoothing)

## Print Settings
- **Nozzle temperature**: 230-250°C
- **Bed temperature**: 100-110°C
- **Print speed**: 40-60 mm/s
- **Cooling**: Minimal or off (causes warping)
- **Retraction**: 2-4mm at 40mm/s

## Tips
- **Requires enclosure** to prevent warping
- Use ABS slurry (ABS + acetone) for bed adhesion
- Well-ventilated area (emits styrene fumes)
- Acetone vapor smoothing for glossy finish

## Environmental Impact
Non-biodegradable, petroleum-based. Recyclable but rarely accepted in municipal programs. Fume emissions during printing.
