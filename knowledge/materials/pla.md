# PLA (Polylactic Acid)

## Overview
PLA is the most popular 3D printing filament, known for its ease of use, low warping, and bio-based origins. Made from renewable resources like corn starch or sugarcane, it's an excellent choice for beginners.

## Properties
- **Strength**: Moderate tensile strength (50-70 MPa)
- **Flexibility**: Brittle, low impact resistance
- **Heat resistance**: Low (softens at 50-60°C)
- **UV resistance**: Poor (degrades over time)
- **Water resistance**: Poor (hygroscopic)

## Applications
- Prototypes and concept models
- Decorative items
- Low-stress functional parts
- Educational projects
- Indoor use only (limited UV/heat resistance)

## Print Settings
- **Nozzle temperature**: 190-220°C (start at 200°C)
- **Bed temperature**: 50-60°C (or unheated with good adhesion)
- **Print speed**: 40-60 mm/s
- **Cooling**: 100% fan after first layer
- **Retraction**: 4-6mm at 40-60mm/s

## Tips
- Prints easily on glass, PEI, or blue tape
- No enclosure needed
- Store in airtight container with desiccant
- Use draft shield for tall prints to prevent warping

## Environmental Impact
PLA is compostable in industrial facilities (requires high heat/humidity). Not biodegradable in typical landfills. Recyclable through specialized programs.
