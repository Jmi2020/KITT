# PETG (Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol)

## Overview
PETG combines the ease of PLA with the strength of ABS. It's durable, chemical-resistant, and widely used for functional parts. Made from the same material as water bottles.

## Properties
- **Strength**: High tensile strength (50-60 MPa), excellent layer adhesion
- **Flexibility**: Semi-flexible, good impact resistance
- **Heat resistance**: Moderate (softens at 80°C)
- **UV resistance**: Good
- **Water resistance**: Excellent

## Applications
- Mechanical parts with stress
- Outdoor use
- Food-safe containers (check manufacturer specs)
- Protective cases and enclosures
- Medical devices (some grades)

## Print Settings
- **Nozzle temperature**: 230-250°C
- **Bed temperature**: 75-90°C
- **Print speed**: 40-50 mm/s
- **Cooling**: 30-50% fan (minimal cooling for best layer adhesion)
- **Retraction**: 3-5mm at 30-40mm/s (lower than PLA to avoid stringing)

## Tips
- Slow down print speed for better results
- Clean bed thoroughly (use IPA for PEI sheets)
- Avoid Z-hop if possible (causes stringing)
- Use higher temps for better layer adhesion

## Environmental Impact
Recyclable in some facilities (PET recycling streams). Less sustainable than PLA but more durable, extending product lifespan.
