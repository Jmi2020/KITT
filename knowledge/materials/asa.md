# ASA (Acrylonitrile Styrene Acrylate)

## Overview
ASA is similar to ABS but with better UV resistance, making it ideal for outdoor applications. Weather-resistant and impact-resistant.

## Properties
- **Strength**: High (45-55 MPa)
- **Flexibility**: Good impact resistance, better than ABS
- **Heat resistance**: High (softens at 100°C)
- **UV resistance**: Excellent (does not yellow)
- **Water resistance**: Excellent

## Applications
- Outdoor functional parts
- Automotive trim
- Garden and outdoor equipment
- Signage and displays
- UV-exposed applications

## Print Settings
- **Nozzle temperature**: 245-260°C
- **Bed temperature**: 100-110°C
- **Print speed**: 40-60 mm/s
- **Cooling**: Minimal
- **Retraction**: 2-4mm at 40mm/s

## Tips
- **Requires enclosure** (similar to ABS)
- Well-ventilated area (emits fumes)
- Excellent layer adhesion
- Can be post-processed with acetone vapor

## Environmental Impact
Petroleum-based, similar to ABS. Not biodegradable. Long lifespan due to UV resistance reduces replacement needs.
